                    which greets you every time you log on to LEARN using Chrome
                    or any other new browser where you didn't simply click 'Allow 
                    Flash'. Clicking that 'Allow Flash' button may seem like an 
                    easier fix than this but it is temporary. This is much more efficient.
                    Use this extension to start enjoying LEARN (and your life in general)
